# 🛒 Simple React Shopping App

This is a small **frontend project** built with **React**. It’s a basic shopping app with login, product list

## ✨ What I Did

- ✅ Used **React** and **React Router** (HashLink, useNavigate)
- ✅ Used **Axios** and **async/await** to fetch real data from **mockapi.io**
- ✅ Created a user **registration** and **login** system
- ✅ Built a **product list** using data from an API

- ✅ Responsive design with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- ✅ Used **Font Awesome** for icons

## 🔧 Technologies

- React
- Axios
- JavaScript (ES6)
- React Router DOM (`useNavigate`, `HashLink`)
- Fetch API
- useState / useEffect
- mockapi.io
- CSS
- Font Awesome

## 🎯 Goal

This project was a learning experience for me to practice working with real APIs, React components, and state management.  
Now I’m looking for real team experience (volunteer, internship, or a small project) to learn more from others. 🙏
